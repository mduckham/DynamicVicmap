This folder includes the files and information for the state-level tests, specifically: 


Other files inside the folder include:
- [Ontology](Ontology/) folder: Includes the list of standard ontology used in this work. The core DynamicVicmap ontology created for this project is [DV_project.rdf](Ontology/DV_project.rdf).
- [Vicmap](VicmapDatasets/) data set: List of data sets integrated in to the KG (please refer to the [Readme.md](../README.md) for downloading them) and metadata info for each dataset.
- Python scripts: for creating wb_instances and integrating flood and parcel dataset into it [data_process.py](data_process.py) and populating instances KG for the whole state of Victoria. 


Populated knowledge graphs are too large to store on this server. Instead, they are stored on the internal Teams site:
- [KG10K.rdf]([https://rmiteduau.sharepoint.com/:u:/r/sites/DynamicVicmapRMITTeam/Shared%20Documents/General/KnowledgeGraphs/KG10K.rdf?csf=1&web=1&e=bVpDYY](https://rmiteduau-my.sharepoint.com/:u:/g/personal/matt_duckham_rmit_edu_au/ERStqVv1vrtMsYziNdFo7rEBMc17wlXNemJKjURucUxEUw?e=2uUUtd): Current version of populated KG with hydro, parcel, and flood datasets for 10K instances (current as of 24.02.13).
- [KG.rdf](https://rmiteduau.sharepoint.com/:u:/r/sites/DynamicVicmapRMITTeam/Shared%20Documents/General/KnowledgeGraphs/KG.rdf?csf=1&web=1&e=dJsJS6): Current version of populated KG with hydro, parcel, and flood datasets for entire state (current as of 24.02.13).

There is also an archive of older versions on the server:
